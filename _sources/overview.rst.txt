Project Overview
################

The **punx** program package is easy to use and has several useful modules.
The first module to try is :ref:`demo <demo>`, which validates 
and prints the structure of a NeXus HDF5 data file from the NeXus documentation.

       demonstrate         demonstrate HDF5 file validation
       install             update the local cache of NeXus definitions
       tree                show tree structure of HDF5 or NXDL file
       validate            validate a NeXus file
   
   Note: It is only necessary to use the first two (or more) characters of any
   subcommand, enough that the abbreviation is unique. Such as: ``demonstrate``
   can be abbreviated to ``demo`` or even ``de``.

**punx** uses a subcommand structure to provide several different modules under one
identifiable program.  These are invoked using commands of the form::

    punx <subcommand> <other parameters>
    
where *<subcommand>* [#]_ is chosen from this table:

=============================  ====================================================
subcommand                     brief description
=============================  ====================================================
:ref:`configuration <config>`  show internal punx configuration
:ref:`demonstrate <demo>`      demonstrate HDF5 file validation
:ref:`install <install>`       update the local cache of NeXus definitions
:ref:`tree <tree>`             show tree structure of HDF5 or NXDL file
:ref:`validate <validate>`     validate a NeXus file
=============================  ====================================================

and the *<other parameters>* are described by the help for each subcommand::

    punx <subcommand> -h

Example ::

   console> punx val -h
   usage: punx validate [-h] [--report REPORT] infile
   
   positional arguments:
     infile           HDF5 or NXDL file name
   
   optional arguments:
     -h, --help       show this help message and exit
     --report REPORT  select which validation findings to report, choices:
                      COMMENT,ERROR,NOTE,OK,OPTIONAL,TODO,UNUSED,WARN


.. [#] **tip**: Subcommands may be shortened to two characters.

   It is only necessary to use the first two (or more) characters of any
   subcommand, enough that the short version remains unique and could not be
   misinterpreted as another subcommand.
   
   .. The program imposes a minimum limit of at least 2-characters.
    
   Such as: ``demonstrate`` can be abbreviated to ``demo`` or even ``de``.
